## 🛠️ Why I Built ThisMathematics in Art Design
- This project is a fractal animation created for my Mathematics in Art Design course.
- I chose the L-shape for its simple recursive beauty that fascinated me since childhood.
- Watching the fractal grow is calming and reveals the elegance within mathematics.

## 🧩 Features
- 🎈 **Floating Balloons** – Balloons smoothly rise with subtle movement variations.
- 🎉 **Falling Confetti** – A lively particle system that scatters colorful confetti across the screen.
- 🚩 **Dynamic Bunting Flags** – Color-changing flags with a wavy rope animation at the top.
- 🎁 **Dropping Gift Boxes** – Randomly falling gifts with bouncing animation and rare golden gift variations.
- 💥 **Fireworks** – Burst-style particle explosions with randomized colors and fading trails.
- 🌏 **Bilingual Message Switching** – Switches title language with scrambling transition effect.
